<div class="textblock"><p>MIMOSAS (Multimodal Input Model Output Security Analysis Suite) is a supervised machine learning pipeline developed for classification of multimodal data to inform nuclear security and proliferation detection scenarios. MIMOSAS provides an end-to-end data processing workflow, from data ingestion and pre-processing to model training and test set classification. The pipeline is specified via an input deck, making workflow customization effortless, and the framework is modular allowing for the easy addition of new learning algorithms.</p>
<p>In the current build, the user selects from decision tree, random forest, and feed-forward neural network classifiers to train customizable models with built-in cross validation methods for hyperparameter optimization. Trained model outputs are stored with the associated metadata for rapid deployment. These can be applied in supervised classification to assess previously unseen data or for further training as new observations are added to the existing data set. MIMOSAS provides the capability to fuse a wide range of data sources (e.g., radiation, environmental, acoustic, seismic, imagery, etc.) to make, confirm, and correlate machine learning predictions for nuclear security applications.</p>
<p>Detailed documentation is available in the <b>MIMOSAS Manual</b>. Visit <a href="https://complexity.berkeley.edu/mimosas/">https://complexity.berkeley.edu/mimosas/</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Python 3 is required to run MIMOSAS, along with the following Python packages:</p><ul>
<li>numpy,</li>
<li>scipy,</li>
<li>pandas,</li>
<li>scikit-learn,</li>
<li>pytorch, and</li>
<li>keras.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<p>To run the software using the default config file: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">python main.py</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> To run the software using a custom config file: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">python main.py --config custom.config</div></div><!-- fragment --><h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>MIMOSAS uses Doxygen to generate documentation. To compile the documentation, install Doxygen and issue the following command from the main directory: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">doxygen Doxyfile</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> The folder <em>docs</em> contains all the documentation source pages. These are also hosted via pages at <a href="https://nonproliferation.github.io/mimosas/">https://nonproliferation.github.io/mimosas/</a>.</p>
